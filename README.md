Code repository for "The Role of Experience in Prioritizing Hippocampal Replay". If you use this code in your research, please cite this paper.

### Prerequisites and installation
- MATLAB 2017a or newer (working on MATLAB 2021a and MATLAB 2022b).
- MATLAB Toolboxes:
    Parallel Computing Toolbox
    Signal Processing Toolbox
    Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Add this repository into the path by using 'set path' -> 'Add with subfolders' (installation time less than 10 seconds)
- klustakwik 2.0 (http://klustakwik.sourceforge.net/)
- Ph-GUI (https://github.com/kwikteam/phy)

### Preprocessing  
Go to **batch_analysis.m** for most basic preprocessing pipelines including:
- 1 - spikes & video ;
- 2 - position & laps ;
- 3 - sleep processing ;
- 4 - CSC & PSD ;
- 5 - Place cells and Bayesian decoding ;
- 6 - Candidate replay event extraction and replay decoding ;
- 7 - replay scoring and significance

### Main analysis
- Place field analysis folder (main code: **place_field_analysis_pipeline.m**) for place cell quantification and decoding error quantification
- Theta analysis folder (main code: **theta_phase_pipeline.m**) for theta cycles and theta sequence quantification
- Replay analysis folder (main code: **replay_analysis_pipeline.m**) for:
  - Replay quantification
  - Quantifying the relationship between theta and awake replay and behavioral parameters vs sleep replay
